# Driveway

## Notes
We loved the idea that you mentioned when we met at the site of having some sort of car-port. Our car gets washed every weekend so having access to power + water in the driveway would be great. 

Also, thinking ahead a bit, an electric car is definitely in our future so a car-port with charging station would be good to plan in now. 

Due to limited on street parking having enough space for 3-4 cars in the driveway would help.
